<span> and <div> define a section/devision 
on an html page
typically we use a pair of these tags as a
container for html elements so we can style
something specific with CSS or perform some
sort of procedure using Javascript with 
anything marked with this tags.

<span> and <div> are almost identical. However,
anything within a pair of <div> tag is considered
a block level element so it will begin on a new
line and take up the full width available on
the webpage.
